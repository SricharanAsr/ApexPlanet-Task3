## Deep-Dive: Cohort Analysis (Retention)

The cohort analysis groups customers by their first purchase month (2025-01 through 2025-11) and tracks their return rate over subsequent months (Month 1 to Month 12).

### Key Findings:
- **High Day-1 Retention:** Most cohorts show substantial repeat activity in the second month (e.g., 2025-01 cohort had 34.78% return in Month 2).
- **Stability:** Retention rates tend to stabilize between 30% and 50% for most cohorts after the third month, signifying a loyal core customer base.
- **Top Performer:** The 2025-01 cohort showed a remarkable peak of 56.52% retention in Month 5.
- **Trend:** There is a slight upward trend in Month 2 retention for later cohorts (e.g., 2025-07 cohort at 63.49% in Month 2), suggesting improved onboarding or product-market fit.

## Dashboard Visualization
The interactive dashboard provides a real-time heatmap of these cohorts, allowing stakeholders to identify "leaky" months and optimize re-engagement campaigns.
